# ZTS
The ZTW is a lua wizard for Edgetx to make model settings.

Included is ZTS, a telemetry screen that accesses the config data generated by ZTW and provides information about the model.


Currently there are three main categories.
Car, Motorcycle and Crawler


The project is still in its early stages and is tailored to my models.
The code is kept in such a way that extensions can be easily added at any time.


Usage:
Download the release and copy the contents of the zip file to the SD card.

Press the SYS button to open the Tools menu in the remote control and select ZTW.

Make the desired settings and save them on the last page.
ATTENTION: Model data will be overwritten. It is best to start with an empty model!

To use the ZTS telemetry screen, switch to Script on the Display page in Screen 1 under Model settings and select ZTS as the telemetry script.
